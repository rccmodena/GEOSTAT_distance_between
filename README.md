# Project: Distance Between

This is a simple project to generate a graphic that displays the distance between all point of a mineral deposit, imported from a text file.

The text file must contain the coordinates of each point in meters.

The graph displays the following distances:

- The azimuth grouped in 45ยบ;
- The dip grouped in 22.5ยบ;
- The mean inside square brackets [];
- The median inside curly brackets {};
- The total number of calculated pairs inside round brackets ();
